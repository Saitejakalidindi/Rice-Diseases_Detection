'Bacterial leaf blight':"Bacterial blight is caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv oryzae. It causes wilting of seedlings and yellowing and drying of leaves.",
'Brown spot':"Brown spot has been historically largely ignored as one of the most common and most damaging rice diseases.",
'Leaf smut':"Leaf smut causes chalkiness of grains which leads to reduction in grain weight. It also reduces seed germination."
}
dis_occurs={
'Bacterial leaf blight':"The disease is most likely to develop in areas that have weeds and stubbles of infected plants. It can occur in both tropical and temperate environments, particularly in irrigated and rainfed lowland areas. In general, the disease favors temperatures at 25âˆ’34Â°C, with relative humidity above 70%. It is commonly observed when strong winds and continuous heavy rains occur, allowing the disease-causing bacteria to easily spread through ooze droplets on lesions of infected plants. Bacterial blight can be severe in susceptible rice varieties under high nitrogen fertilization.",
'Brown spot':"The disease can develop in areas with high relative humidity (86âˆ’100%) and temperature between 16 and 36Â°C. It is common in unflooded and nutrient-deficient soil, or in soils that accumulate toxic substances. For infection to occur, the leaves must be wet for 8âˆ’24 hours. The fungus can survive in the seed for more than four years and can spread from plant to plant through air.",
'Leaf smut':'''The disease can occur in areas with high relative humidity (>90%) and temperature ranging from 25âˆ’35 ÂºC.  Rain, high humidity, and soils with high nitrogen content also favors disease development. Wind can spread the fungal spores from plant to plant.'''

                           | ------------- |
                           | Use balanced amounts of plant nutrients, especially nitrogen.      | 
                           | Allow fallow fields to dry in order to suppress disease agents in the soil and plant residues.    | 
                           | Ensure good drainage of fields (in conventionally flooded crops) and nurseries. | ''',

'Brown spot':'''           | Solution        |
